<h2> Week 7 </h2>
<p>This week we are piecing together two robots: one egg-bot that can paint on eggs and another robot that can stand up on its own.</p>
<p>We used these two guides for the robots: <a href="http://www.jjrobots.com/sphere-o-bot-assembly-and-user-guide/">egg-bot</a> and <a href="http://www.jjrobots.com/b-robot-evo-2-assembly-guide/">b-robot</a>.</p>
<p>We were not able to use inkscape to paint the wooden eggs, but the results are here.</p>

	<p>We were able to start up the b-robot, and the system worked fine, but the problem is that the 3D-printed wheeels are too smooth and did not offer any friction for the wheels to turn. Nevertheless, here is its photo.</p>
