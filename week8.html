<h2> Week 8 </h2>
<p>This week the task was to learn about CNC milling and mill out a model out of wax.</p>
<p>However, because Mr. Gerber was visiting a school, we were not doing that until Thursday. For the first few days of the week, I UV printed a new phone case for my mom, and then printed out some vinyl sticker for Starcraft II.</p>
	<p>For the MDX40A machine, we have to design a 3D stl model and mill it out in wax. Following Dr.Borrmann's instruction, I designed the 3D buddy bear model with flat back (to make good candies).</p>
	<p>The files are as follows: <a href="Buddy Bear Slice.stl" target="_blank">Bear</a>, <a href="Arsenal.stl" target="_blank">Arsenal</a>, and <a href="ILJR.stl" target="_blank">ILJR</a>.</p>
