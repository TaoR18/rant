<h2> Week 1 </h2>
<p>The first week was mostly introduction and trivialities of the course. However, on Friday we had a group challenge where we need to build a tower with thin, long, yellow pasta strips that can bear the weight of a marshmellow on top.</p>
<p>Our group decided to build a triangular base first before we construct hight levels. After the base was laid down, we opted for the short cut solution of creating long pillars and some buttresses on each side. However, it turns out that the buttresses and the long pillars are not strong enough for the weight of a marshmellow. Despite the low material cost, the structure eventually failed to stand on its feet.</p>
