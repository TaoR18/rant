<h2> Week 1 </h2>
<p>The first week was mostly introduction and trivialities of the course. However, on Friday we had a group challenge where we need to build a tower with thin, long, yellow spaghetti strips, strings, and tape that can bear the weight of a marshmellow on top.</p>
<p>Our group decided to build a triangular base first before we construct hight levels. After the base was laid down, we opted for the short cut solution of creating long pillars and some buttresses on each side. Each connection point is fortified with tapes and strings. However, it turns out that the buttresses and the long pillars are not strong enough for the weight of a marshmellow. Eventually the structure only held on for about 5 seconds before it went down to pebbles. Despite the low material cost, the structure eventually failed to stand on its feet.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately I did not take any pictures of the eventual structure, but the important point is that we need to balance the risk and the material cost. The best team used triangular structure throughout the storeys. They used more spaghetti strips with each storey, but each storey is also much stabler than ours. Their base is also triangular, but each storey up they build additional horizontal platforms to stabilize the structure.</p>
