<h2> Week 5 </h2>
<p>This week we are exploring more with CorelDraw and Laser printing. The assignment is to create an engraving on a bottle and a personal stamp.</p>
<p>My design for the bottle is simply a quote from Nietzsche that I like a lot. The orginial file is <a href="WaterBottle.ai" targe="_blank">here.</a></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>However, I messed up the settings and the laser cutter only cut through part of the paint.</p>
<br>
<img src="IMG_1309_opt.jpg" alt="Bottle" >
<br>
<p>Thus I put the tape alongside the first letter H, and try to manipulate the laser such that the cut fits the original.</p>
<img src="IMG_1310_opt.jpg" alt="Tape">
<br>
<p>The result is much better.</p>

<br>
<p>The second assignment is to make a stamp. The basic idea is to engrave on a 2.5" by 1" piece of rubber, and then glue the rubber to the bottom of a wooden base.</p>
<p>I design the stamp to have both the element of <a href="http://www.arsenal.com/home">Arsenal</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4F0ytNzHDj8">"Like a rolling stone".</a></p>
<br>

<br>
<p>And the product is this. You can see that the upper half is not clear. That is because I tried to reprint it on the same piece again to better the resolution. However, that didn't work.</p>

<br>
	<p>After reprinting the image and cleaning up the excess rubber, I managed to better the stamp and here is the final product.</p>
