<h2> Week 1 </h2>
<p>This week we are trying out the VCarve program and the ShopBot to familiarize ourselves with the process. Our assignment is to CAM out a sign for ourselves and I did one with the words SOLOMID CHAMPION in Gothic font. </p>
<p>Using the VCarve program was relatively straightforward, but in the process of creating the routes, I used two different bits for the inside engraving and the outside border. It turns out that changing bits is quite hazardous for a green hand in the field. After I drilled in the media and set the origin point in the machine, the engraving bit started its almost-eight-hour toil.</p>
<p>The next day the inside came out in perfect shape, but the fatal step of changing the bit finally came. I screwed in the bit the best I could, but still when running the program, the bit broke off from the machine. Luckily, the bit did not break, and at the second go the border was cut clear. The only problem is that after the emergency stop, the zero that the program had in memory was lost, and I had to reset the zero, which led to deviations from the original design. The result was comforting in that it proved my program was right, but also a bit disappointing because the sign was not well enclosed.</p>
