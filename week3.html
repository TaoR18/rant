<h2> Week 3 </h2>
<p>The first assignment for the week was to use Adobe Illustrator to create a pattern or image to print on our personalized T-shirt.</p>
<h2>Adobe Illustrator</h2>
<p>In order to promote a student website on campus, I made a logo shirt.</p>
<img src="Reserve Scope Design.jpg" alt="T-Shirt Design" >
<p>Below is the printed product.</p>
<img src="IMG_1302_opt.jpg" alt="Printed copy">
<p>The shirt was intended to be part of the PR campaign for Reserve Scope. However, after discussing with some of my peers, I realized that the image was too violent.</p>
<p>Thus I changed the image to a magnifying glass and put the view on the back.</p>
<img src="Shirt02.jpg" alt="New T-shirt" >
<br>
<img src="Shirt03.jpg" alt="New T-shirt Back" >
<br>
The final product is eventually approved and one of the head officials wore it for cross-country practice.

<p>The original files are here: <a href="Reserve Scope.ar3" target="_blank">Front</a> and <a href="Reserve Scope Back.jpg" target="_blank">Back</a></p>
<p>The other assignment is to use to UV printer. I designed a pattern of text with Illustrator.</p>
<br>

	<p>And the final product looks like this.</p>
