<h2> Week 4 </h2>
<p>This week we are trying to use Corel Draw and the laser cutter to produce some boxes or puzzles of our own.</p>
<p>The first design that I had was a grading die for teachers, designed to relieve educators of their troubles at grading.</p>

<p>After setting the suitable rastering and vectoring parts, I printed the box plan on the laser printer. After some efforts at gluing the facets together, I get a final result.</p>

<p>From the picture it is not hard to see that although the cutting process was successful, the engraved figures were not that clear and deep. I good solution would probably be to fill the relief with black ink to make them stand out to the eye.</p>
