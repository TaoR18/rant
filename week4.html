<h2> Week 4 </h2>
<p>This week we are trying to use Corel Draw and the laser cutter to produce some boxes or puzzles of our own.</p>
<p>The first design that I had was a grading die for teachers, designed to relieve educators of their troubles at grading.</p>
<img src="BoxDesign.jpg" alt="Box Design" >
<p>After setting the suitable rastering and vectoring parts, I printed the box plan on the laser printer. After some efforts at gluing the facets together, I get a final result.</p>

<img src="IMG_1299_opt.jpg" alt="Box02" >
<p>From the picture it is not hard to see that although the cutting process was successful, the engraved figures were not that clear and deep. I good solution would probably be to fill the relief with black ink to make them stand out to the eye.</p>
<p>The final result is this.</p>
<img src="IMG_1308_opt.jpg" alt="Box03">
<p>In addition to the box, I created a puzzle using the puzzle template with our school emblem and some Latin on it.</p>
<img src="IMG_1305_opt.jpg" alt="Puzzle01">
<p>As you can see, the engravings are recognizable, but the Latin script is not very refined. Thus, I used the marker to outline the letters.</p>
