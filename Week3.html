<h2> Week 3 </h2>
<p>This week we are aiming to complete a plasma-cut piece for ourselves. I, as usual, chose to print out a Reserve Scope logo to honor the publication. I used CorelDraw to trace out the logo first and then exported it as a .dxf file into EnRoute to route the job.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Gerber suggested that if I just simply go with the original design, many of the pieces would fall off simply because its boundary is cut and there is no supporting structure. Thus I used PS to erase some of the borders and then went through the same process and CAM the job.</p>
<p>The file for the design is <a href="Scope Relief.dxf">here</a>.</p>
