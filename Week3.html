<h2> Week 3 </h2>
<p>This week we are aiming to complete a plasma-cut piece for ourselves. I, as usual, chose to print out a Reserve Scope logo to honor the publication. I used CorelDraw to trace out the logo first and then exported it as a .dxf file into EnRoute to route the job.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Gerber suggested that if I just simply go with the original design, many of the pieces would fall off simply because its boundary is cut and there is no supporting structure. Thus I used PS to erase some of the borders and then went through the same process and CAM the job.</p>
<p>The file for the design is <a href="Scope Relief.dxf">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, I soon discovered that my design will lead to all the parts falling off of the main metal structure. Thus, I redesigned the sign by adding a inner loop and a outer loop to it.</p>
	<p>The new design file is <a href="Scope.rou">here</a>.</p>
	<p>After installing and zeroing in the apparatus, we exported the files into .tap files and cut it out.</p>
	<br>

	<p>The sign itself has an OK size, but the letters are too thin, which suggests that the inner loop should be smaller and the font of the letters should be larger.</p>
