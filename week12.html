<h2> Week 12 </h2>
<p>This week we were asked to produce a circuit out of a chibitronics or bare conductive kit and solder together a small chip.</p>
<p>For the circuit part, I must confess that I have not really completed what I envisioned. I started out trying to make a Whac-A-Mole game. The basic idea is to have a parallel circuit around the hole and initially the lights are on, but as the player presses down on the mole (which has a conductive part in the center), the other branch is connected and the lights would be short-circuited.</p>

<p>The final product, unfortunately, is nowhere near it---but the lights did work.</p>

<p>In terms of the soldering, I was much more successful. I managed to put together a sound-LED kit.</p>
