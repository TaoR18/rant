<h2> Week 12 </h2>
<p>This week we were asked to produce a circuit using two processes and solder together a small chip.</p>
<p>For the circuit part, at first I did not really completed what I envisioned. I started out trying to make a Whac-A-Mole game. The basic idea is to have a parallel circuit around the hole and initially the lights are on, but as the player presses down on the mole (which has a conductive part in the center), the other branch is connected and the lights would be short-circuited.</p>

<p>The final product, unfortunately, is nowhere near it---but the lights did work.</p>

<br>
<p>To finish the circuit, I first printed a Whac-A-Mole background and then cut a small hole for the LED. After that, I used the Arduino pressure sensor and coded it to work for the Whac-A-Mole game. I designed the circuit such that if the player taps at the nose of the mole, the LED will turn off and a sound will ring to congratulate the player. Here is a <a href="https://youtu.be/xbp9SB8t_sM">video</a> of it working.</p>

	<p>The code is <a href="Press02.ino" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<p>In terms of the soldering, I was much more successful. I managed to put together a sound-LED kit.</p>
